My visual shows the growth and decline of the unemployment rate for those with just a high school diploma as well as those with some college experience. It also shows the general unemployment rate for the area of Ann Arbor, MI. The visual addresses my question by showing explicitly the trends for each of these variables in direct relation to one another. I thought about incorporating the labor force participation rate (as that can sometimes explain a decrease in unemployment) however I decided against it for fear of over clutter.

My Visual shows that for the most part, unemployment remains fairly steady at 8% for those who have some college experience but no college degree. 
However the trend for those with just a high school diploma shows a much less stable reality. 
For those with just a high school diploma the visual shows that just after the recession unemployment was very high for them compared to the rest of the workers in Ann Arbor. 
It also shows that as the years have gone on the unemployment rate for those with just a high school diploma has dropped dramatically. 
This trend never seems to find any sort of consistency and is always moving. 
There are other factors that I would like to explore to help explain some of the things seen in this visual. 
I was unable to find reliable information regarding average income in Ann Arbor for the various levels of education. 
I think that adding that in will be interesting.
